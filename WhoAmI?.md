- Hey, I’m @YamiRaii

- There isn't much to wonder about when it comes to me, but in short, I…

  I'm Yami, Junior Web Developer, UI / UX Designer and maybe Programmer (If the definition of programmer includes web developer.).

  I know how to create a professionally designed and responsive website, or I know how to use professional design tools like Figma to create designs that appeal to         the eye, draw attention, and concentrate the customer's attention on your items. And I'd be delighted to provide them for you. Please do not hesitate to get in           touch with me.
